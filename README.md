node.py is a dependency of Stack.py
Stack.py is a dependency of script.py

Rules of the game are here:
1) get all the disks from the Left stack to the Right stack
2) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
3) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack. 
In other words, a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
4) No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
